GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) {{YEAR}}  {{AUTHOR}}
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a
mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library, but as opposed to using the Library,
is not governed by this License.  The "Corresponding Source" for a
Combined Work means Corresponding Source for the Combined Work,
excluding any source code for parts of the Combined Work that,
considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on
the Library being linked with.

"Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

a) under this License, provided that you make clear to the recipients
that the Library is used in your modification, and provide them with
information reasonably sufficient to locate the modified Library; or

b) under the GNU GPL, with the complete machine-readable "work that
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
recipients can relink or recompile the application with the modified
Library.  (Alternative conveying of the Library may be in the form of
source code or object code, with accompanying scripts to recompile.)

The information you provide must include a copy of this License and
the notice required by section 4 of the GNU GPL.  You must make the
modified Library available in source code form, under the terms of
sections 1 and 2 above, on a medium customarily used for software
interchange.

3. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
conveyed under the terms of this License.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

4. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
published version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
version number, you may choose any version ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.

5. If you modify a copy of the Library, or any portion of it,
or any derivative work, and you wish to prevent others from using
your derivative work on a different basis (for example, charging a
fee for the act of linking your derivative work to the Library), you
must provide adequate information, in a prominent and clearly
accessible place in the modified Library, that gives adequate notice
of your right to prevent use of your modified version for those
users.  This must include a copy of this License (with the text
as modified, as needed) and any additional terms you choose to
offer, in the manner described in section 4 above.

This License includes the complete Library, together with any
other software, documentation, and other data provided in connection
with the Library, in a volume usable within a system, and provides
permissions for the use of that volume on a different basis,
as described in section 2 above.  It also provides permissions
to modify or combine the Library with other software, and to copy
and distribute the resulting combined library under the terms
of your choice, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The combined library must contain prominent notice that it is
based on this Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same Library.

b) The combined library must be accompanied by a copy of this
License (with the text as modified, as needed) and any notices
required by section 4 of the GNU GPL.

c) You must not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of
the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example,
you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for the
exercise of rights granted under this License for the combined
library.

d) If the combined library is used to provide facilities for a
product or service, you must give recipients of the combined
library notice that it is a derivative of the Library, and offer
them the terms of this License in connection with the entire
combined library.
